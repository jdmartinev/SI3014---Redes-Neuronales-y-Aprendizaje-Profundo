## Roadmap of the course

**[Roadmap of the Course](/Lecture01/schedule.md)**


## We will learn in this course:

* **Neural Networks** and **Deep Learning**, which are at the core of modern AI. We will illustrate the concepts behind these important topics using code in two of the most popular frameworks - [TensorFlow](http://Tensorflow.org) and [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org).
* **Neural Architectures** for working with images and text. We will cover recent models but may be a bit lacking in the state-of-the-art.
* State of the art Generative AI applications.
